An intricate characteristic of us humans is that we often take for granted the things we get too easily. We never give them the respect they deserve. Take, for instance… our underwear.

**Have you ever stopped to consider how crucial underwear is in our lives?**

Sure, it might seem like just a piece of cloth, but pause for a moment and imagine life without it.

## Impossible.

Now, let’s flip the perspective for a second. Have you ever thought about the pain and suffering your underwear endures? It's one of those silent, loyal soldiers without whom we can’t function, yet we treat it like... nothing.

## Rewind.

Think back to that glorious moment when you brought home brand-new underwear. Fresh, vibrant, and full of life. But what did you do next? You thrust it into a world of unimaginable horrors.

The poor thing had no clue where it was headed. And then, the suffering began — bacterial invasions, microbial terrorism, ghastly odors, suffocating hairy surroundings, and the seismic shockwaves of farts. It’s subjected to every form of cruelty imaginable. And to make matters worse — some of us don’t even bother changing it daily.

## Insane!

Years pass by, and the relentless abuse drains all the energy from our once vibrant underwear. It loses its charm, becomes powerless, develops holes, and yet… we refuse to let it retire with dignity. No, we drag it further into misery — demoting it to a rag, a mop, a dust cleaner. And why? Because it can’t scream, “Enough!”

But let’s be real. Our lives are so comfortable because of underwear. If comfort doesn’t convince you to show some respect, think hygiene. Underwear is that unacknowledged guardian, absorbing our horrific bodily excretions to keep us clean and safe. It’s the unsung hero that protects our outerwear from stains and embarrassment.

## Introspect.

Like this poor, selfless underwear, everything we take for granted — living or non-living — deserves some respect. We’re lucky to have these things.

**The least we can do is value what we have got. Because if they’re gone, it’s not them who’ll suffer. It’s us.**

Underwear or no underwear — the choice is yours.
