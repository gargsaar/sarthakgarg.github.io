Interacting with a computer through a command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful technique as it greatly improves productivity during development. In-fact, mastering the command-line is a must for every programmer or data scientist.

I have been using CLI since my early programming days primarily for installing libraries or executing python commands. But as I’m learning newer commands, especially outside the programming realm, I’m falling in love with CLI more than ever. Below is a curated list of my FIVE favorite commands I’m sure you all will love too:

**1. VIDEO DOWNLOAD**

Download video+audio either single files or entire playlists. youtube-dl is a command-line program that allows you to download videos from YouTube and other sites such as Vimeo. It requires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not platform-specific, and works on your Unix box, on Windows or on macOS.
Installation:

You can download youtube-dl and copy it to /usr/local/bin/. It is released to the public domain on github, which means you can modify it, redistribute it or use it however you like.

sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
Alternatively, you can also use pip:
sudo -H pip install --upgrade youtube-dl

Syntax:
youtube-dl [OPTIONS] URL [URL...]
Options
   -F, --list-formats         List all available formats.
   -f, --format FORMAT        Video format code, see example below.
   -i, --ignore-errors        Continue on download errors, for example to skip unavailable
                              videos in a playlist.
   --abort-on-error           Cancel downloading of further videos (in the playlist or the
                              command line) if an error occurs.
   --no-playlist              Download only the video, if the URL refers to a video and a playlist.
   --yes-playlist             Download the playlist, if the URL refers to a video and a playlist.
   -a, --batch-file FILE      File containing URLs to download ('-' for stdin.)
   --restrict-filenames       Restrict filenames to only ASCII characters, and avoid "&" and
                              spaces in filenames.
   -w, --no-overwrites        Do not overwrite files.
   --write-description        Write video description to a .description file.
   --write-info-json          Write video metadata to a .info.json file.
   --write-annotations        Write video annotations to a .annotations.xml file.
   -q, --quiet                Activate quiet mode.
   --no-mtime                 Set the file last modified date/time to the download date/time.
   --no-warnings              Ignore warnings.
   --console-title            Display progress in console titlebar.
   --sleep-interval SECONDS   Number of seconds to sleep before each download.
   -h, --help                 Print this help text and exit.
   -U, --update               Update this program to latest version. Make sure that you have
                              sufficient permissions (run with sudo if needed.)
   --version                  Print program version and exit.

Usage:
First list the available formats with -F
$ youtube-dl -F https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG1VVFfOnYQ
140          m4a        audio only DASH audio  127k , m4a_dash container, aac  @128k (44100Hz), 3.77MiB
141          m4a        audio only DASH audio  255k , m4a_dash container, aac  @256k (44100Hz), 7.57MiB ***
160          mp4        256x144    DASH video  113k , 12fps, video only, 3.24MiB
133          mp4        426x240    DASH video  269k , 24fps, video only, 7.27MiB
134          mp4        640x360    DASH video  272k , 24fps, video only, 6.55MiB
244          webm       854x480    DASH video  504k , 24fps, video only, 7.95MiB
135          mp4        854x480    DASH video  540k , 24fps, video only, 13.33MiB
136          mp4        1280x720   DASH video 1155k , 24fps, video only, 26.62MiB
248          webm       1920x1080  DASH video 1797k , 24fps, video only, 30.81MiB
137          mp4        1920x1080  DASH video 2750k , 24fps, video only, 57.97MiB   ***   
43           webm       640x360    
18           mp4        640x360    
22           mp4        1280x720   (best)

Using the codes in the very first column, you can select a specific size of Video and Audio.

For example, let’s download 1920x1080 resolution video (137) plus 255K audio (141) so the command becomes:
youtube-dl -f 137+141 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG1VVFfOnYQ

If you just want the highest possible quality, this is the default so all you need is:
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG1VVFfOnYQ

By default the date/time of the downloaded file will be equal to the upload date/time, to disable this and return the downloaded date use the option — no-mtime.

**2. STAY AWAKE**

Prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility.

Syntax:
caffeinate [-disu] [-t timeout] [-w pid] [utility arguments...]

Key
   -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.
   -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.
   -m      Create an assertion to prevent the disk from idle sleeping.
   -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This
           assertion is valid only when system is running on AC power.
   -u      Create an assertion to declare that user is active.
           If the display is off, this option turns the display on and prevents the display from going
           into idle sleep. If a timeout is not specified with '-t' option, then this assertion is
           taken with a default of 5 second timeout.
   -t      Specifies the timeout value in seconds for which this assertion has to be valid.
           The assertion is dropped after the specified timeout.
           Timeout value is not used when an utility is invoked with this command.
   -w      Waits for the process with the specified pid to exit. Once the  the process exits, the assertion is also released.  This option is ignored when used with utility option.

Usage:
Prevent sleep for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
caffeinate -u -t 3600

Make caffeinate fork a process, exec “make” in it, and hold an assertion that prevents idle sleep as long as that process is running:
caffeinate -i make

**3. SCREENSHOT**

Capture an image of the whole, or part of the screen.

Syntax:
screencapture [options] [file]

Key
   -c   Force screen capture to go to the clipboard.
   -C   Capture the cursor as well as the screen.  Only allowed in 
        non-interactive modes.
   -d   Display errors to the user graphically.
   -i   Capture screen interactively, by selection or window.
          The control key = copy screen to the clipboard.
          The space key will toggle between mouse selection and
             window selection modes.
          The escape key will cancel the screen shot.
   -m   Only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set.
   -M   Open the taken picture in a new Mail message.
   -o   In window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window.
   -P   Open the taken picture in a Preview window.
   -s   Only allow mouse selection mode.
   -S   In window capture mode, capture the screen instead of the window.
   -t format   Image format to create, default is png (other options
               include pdf, jpg, tiff and others).
   -T seconds  Take the picture after a delay of seconds, default=5
               Handy for arranging windows/menus before taking the screenshot.
   -w   Only allow window selection mode.
   -W   Start interaction in window selection mode.
   -x   Do not play sounds.
   -l windowid  Capture a specific windowsid.
   -R x,y,w,h   Capture a screen rectangle, top,left,width,height.
  file  Where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen.
  -help Display brief syntax summary.

Usage:
Use the command below to take a screen shot of the select area. The mouse will turn into crosshairs, hit the space bar for camera mode, now click the window, a file called “example.png” will appear on your desktop.

screencapture -i ~/Desktop/example.png

**4. TEXT TO SPEECH**

Convert text to audible speech.

This tool uses the Speech Synthesis manager to convert input text to audible speech and either play it through the sound output device chosen in System Preferences or save it to an AIFF file.

Syntax:
say [-v voice] [-o out.aiff | -n name:port ] [-f file.in | string ...]

Key
   string   The text to speak on the command line.
            This can consist of multiple arguments, which are
            considered to be separated by spaces.
   --input-file=file
   -f file  A file to be spoken.
            If file is - or neither this parameter nor a message
            is specified, read from standard input.
   --file-format=format
            The format of the file to write (AIFF, caff, m4af, WAVE).
            Generally, it's easier to specify a suitable file extension
            for the output file. To obtain a list of writable file formats,
            specify '?' as the format name.
   --data-format=format
            The format of the audio data to be stored. default=linear PCM.
   --progress    Display a progress meter during synthesis.
   --rate=rate

   -v voice      The voice to be used: English language = Alex, Daniel, Fiona, Fred, Samantha or Victoria
                 Default is the voice selected in System Preferences | Speech
                 Other voices are available for foreign languages.
   --voice=?     List all available voices.
   --output-file=fileout.aiff
   -o fileout.aiff
                 An AIFF file to be written, some voices support other file formats.
   --channels=channels   The number of channels. Most synthesizers produce mono audio only.
   --bit-rate=rate       The bit rate for formats, default=AAC.specify '?' as the rate.
   --quality=quality     The audio converter quality level between 0 (lowest) and 127 (highest).
   --network-send=name
   -n name
   --network-send=name:port
   -n name:port
   --network-send=:port
   -n :port
   --network-send=:
   -n :          Specify a service name (default "AUNetSend") and/or IP port to be
                 used for redirecting the speech output through AUNetSend.
                 specify '?' as the device name to obtain a list of audio output devices.

Usage:
say -f myfile.txt
cat myfile.txt | say

**5. SYSTEM SETUP**
