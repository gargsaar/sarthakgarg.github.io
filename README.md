## About

Hola! My name is [Sarthak](https://sarthakgarg.com/about_me.html)… and I’ve a [standpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/about/).

[iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/) a repository of my beliefs and ideas from which opinions and decisions are formed. It’s my legacy :).

The reason I decided to start a blog was to do my bit to give back to all those and others from whom I’ve learned. The very things that makes us (humans) special - the ability to pass on the beliefs and ideas from one person to another.
