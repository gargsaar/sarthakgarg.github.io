# About

Hola! I'm [Sarthak](https://sarthakgarg.com/about_me.html)...and I've a standpoint. 

[iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com) is my digital space — a repository of my learnings, beliefs, and ideas that shape my opinions and decisions. It’s more than just a blog; it’s my legacy, etched in words.

Writing has always been close to my heart. I’ve carried this passion for as long as I can remember, and starting a blog was my way of giving back — by sharing my experiences, insights, and reflections to help others learn from what I’ve discovered. After all, isn’t that what makes us human? We learn, we teach, and our stories live on. This ability to pass on knowledge across generations is what sets us apart. I believe this is the [purpose of our life](https://sarthakgarg.com/the-purpose-of-life/).

We often underestimate the boundless potential we hold — the ability to achieve what lies beyond our imagination. The fastest way to achieve the extraordinary isn’t by reinventing the wheel but by standing on the shoulders of those who’ve already pushed the boundaries of thought. Remember, we’re just tiny specks in this vast universe, yet there are billions of minds thinking, evolving, and contributing.

Life isn’t a 100-meter sprint; it’s a relay where we receive the baton from those before us, do our best during our stretch, and pass it on without fumbling. This is [how mankind has evolved](https://sarthakgarg.com/how-to-stay-employable-in-the-age-of-automation/)— one individual, one idea, and one generation at a time. Our role? To keep the baton moving forward.

PS: It's a real [tiger](http://tigerpark.co.th/) cub in the picture above, incase u didn't notice:)
